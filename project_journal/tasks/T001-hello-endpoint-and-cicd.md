# Task Log: T001 - Hello Endpoint and CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal:** Implement a GET endpoint that returns a hello message and create a CI/CD pipeline for multi-environment deployment.

**Context:** Firebase Functions project with multiple Firebase project configurations.

## Initial Analysis

The project already has a basic Firebase Functions setup with:
- Firebase Functions v6.0.1 and Firebase Admin v12.6.0
- TypeScript configuration
- Multiple Firebase project configuration in `.firebaserc`
  - Default: `chris-cole-test`
  - Live: `structify-chris-cole`

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Hello Endpoint Implementation

Added a GET endpoint using Firebase Functions v2 HTTP triggers:
- Endpoint: `/hello`
- Response: JSON with hello message, project ID, and timestamp
- Added proper logging for operational visibility
- Implemented CORS support for cross-origin requests

```typescript
export const hello = onRequest({
  region: 'us-central1',
  cors: true,
}, async (req, res) => {
  // Log the request
  logger.info('Hello endpoint called', {
    projectId: process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT,
    method: req.method,
    url: req.originalUrl,
  });

  // Get the current project ID
  const projectId = process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT || 'unknown';

  // Return a hello message with the project ID
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'Hello from Firebase Functions!',
    projectId: projectId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Created a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment:
- File: `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`
- Trigger: Push to `master` or `testing` branches
- Deployment strategy:
  - `master` branch → `structify-chris-cole` (production)
  - `testing` branch → `chris-cole-test` (development/testing)
- Build steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Node.js 22
  - Install dependencies
  - Build TypeScript
  - Deploy to appropriate Firebase project

### 3. Documentation

- Created README.md with project overview, features, and usage instructions
- Created Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documenting the design decisions
- Created this task log to document the implementation process

## Technical Considerations

- **Regional Deployment**: Deployed the function to `us-central1` for optimal performance
- **CORS Support**: Enabled CORS to allow cross-origin requests
- **Logging**: Implemented structured logging for better observability
- **Project ID in Response**: Included the project ID in the response to easily verify which environment is being accessed

## Next Steps

- Set up GitHub secrets for the CI/CD pipeline
- Consider adding unit and integration tests
- Monitor function performance and adjust configuration as needed
